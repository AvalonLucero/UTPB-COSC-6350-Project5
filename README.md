# UTPB-COSC-6350-Project5
This repo contains the assignment for Project 5 of the graduate Wireless Security class.

The goal of this project is to simulate the Bluetooth/Zigby handshake.

Using either Java, Python, or C#, create an implementation of the handshake a TCP server and client.  We want to properly handle every aspect of the protocol, so the amount of library use allowed is limited.

Once you have completed the simulated handshake and established a shared session key, send a few packets back and forth that are encrypted using the 802.15.* standard methodology.

You may use the built-in libraries for your language of choice to handle the AES and RSA algorithms and the DHE/ECDHE exchange.  No additional library calls will be allowed.
